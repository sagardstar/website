								<a href="#">Sticky Prices vs Sticky Information: Does It Matter For Policy Paradoxes? (with Gauti Eggertsson)</a>
								<br style="display:unset;">
								<b>Abstract:</b> Low natural real interest rates limit the power of monetary policy to revive the economy due to the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal interest rate. Fiscal stabilization via higher public debt is frequently recommended as a policy alternative at the ZLB as it trends to raise the natural real interest rate. This paper builds a non-Ricardian framework to study the costs and benefits of increasing public debt during a ZLB episode. It shows that the effect of debt is highly non-linear. Increasing debt raises the natural real rate of interest at low levels of debt, while at high levels it perversely decreases the natural real interest rate, thereby further complicating the use of monetary policy to fight recessions. The threshold level of debt, beyond which the effect becomes perverse is a function of the duration of the ZLB episode. The mechanism of the perverse effects relies on output distortions created by expectation of high debt burden in possible future states of the world in which the natural real interest rate has normalized and the ZLB is no longer binding. These distortions arise from an increase in distortionary taxes, crowding out of productive capital, and the possibility of sovereign default. In a calibrated 60 period quantitative lifecycle model with aggregate uncertainty, if the ZLB episode is expected to last for 1.5 years, which corresponds to the average length of a recession in the US, this threshold level of debt is at 106% of the GDP. The insights from the paper are applicable to a low real interest rate environment even in a purely real model away from the ZLB.
